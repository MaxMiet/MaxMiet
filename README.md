Hi, I’m Max.
I've been interested in computer science since I was 12, found myself dabbling in code at a young age, at the time I ofcourse did not understand it
but I had a burning passion to try to start understanding it.
so over time I developed skills to research and find information online that I needed to help me learn and understand anything I needed, anything I found interesting at the time.
ex. reverse engineering, game hacking, game bot scripts, bruteforcing and much more.
These topics interested me to a big degree, but I could not pursue any of these interests fully, until recently.

Currently working on improving myself and moving forward with my self-teaching journey.
So far python is definitely my favorite language I've dabbled in, trying to reach new heights with python to see what I can achieve all by my self. baby steps so far haha.
Any code you'll find here will probably be newbie-like and messy, but over time, with passion comes progress.
Also very interested in cyber security stuff, currently mainly starting out on HackThebox and TryHackMe challenges, working through the basics.
